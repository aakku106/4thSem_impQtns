## üéØ **The 35+ Marks Strategy: A Three-Tiered Approach**

Focus on mastering Tier 1 completely, then move to Tier 2. This alone will secure your target. Tier 3 is for pushing your score higher if you have extra time.

### **Tier 1: The "Guaranteed Marks" Core (Secure 20-25 Marks)**

These topics are your highest priority. They appear consistently and form the backbone of the exam. Master these first.

| Topic                             | Unit | Type  | Frequency | What to Master                                                                                                                                                                           | Expected Marks |
| :-------------------------------- | :--- | :---- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| **Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)** | 7    | Long  | **5/7**   | **Process**: Define anomalies. Take an unnormalized table and convert it to 1NF, then 2NF, then 3NF, explaining the "why" at each step (removing partial/transitive dependencies).       | **10**         |
| **SQL & Relational Algebra**      | 6, 5 | Long  | **5/7**   | **Queries**: Practice writing `SELECT` with `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and aggregates (`COUNT`, `AVG`). Be able to write the equivalent Relational Algebra expression (using œÉ, œÄ, ‚ãà). | **10**         |
| **Functional Dependencies**       | 7    | Short | **6/7**   | **Concepts**: Define FD. Understand Armstrong's Axioms (Reflexivity, Augmentation, Transitivity). Be able to find the closure of a set of attributes (e.g., find {A, B}+).               | **5**          |

**Outcome of Tier 1**: By mastering just these three areas, you are positioned to answer **one guaranteed long question** and **one guaranteed short question**, securing **15 marks**. Since Normalization and SQL are the most frequent long questions, you have a very high chance of getting one of them. This tier realistically prepares you for about **20-25 marks**.

### **Tier 2: The "High-Probability" Booster (Add 15-20 Marks)**

These topics appear frequently as short questions. They are quick to learn and offer a great return on time invested.

| Topic                             | Unit | Type       | Frequency | What to Master                                                                                                                                                     | Expected Marks |
| :-------------------------------- | :--- | :--------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| **Transaction Properties (ACID)** | 8    | Short      | **5/7**   | **ACID**: Define Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability with a simple one-sentence explanation for each.                                                | **5**          |
| **Three-Schema Architecture**     | 2    | Short      | **5/7**   | **Diagram**: Draw the diagram showing External, Conceptual, and Internal schemas. Explain the purpose of each and define Logical and Physical Data Independence.   | **5**          |
| **Serializability**               | 8    | Short      | **5/7**   | **Conflict Serializability**: Know how to draw a precedence (dependency) graph for a given schedule to check for cycles. If no cycles, it's conflict-serializable. | **5**          |
| **Concurrency Control (2PL)**     | 9    | Long/Short | **4/7**   | **Two-Phase Locking**: Explain the expanding (growing) and shrinking phases. Differentiate between Basic, Strict, and Rigorous 2PL.                                | **5**          |

**Outcome of Tier 2**: Mastering this tier prepares you for **3-4 additional short questions**, adding another **15-20 marks** to your score.

**Combined Tier 1 + Tier 2 Score Projection: 35-45 Marks**

### **Tier 3: The "Safety Net" Topics (Secure 5-10 Extra Marks)**

If you have more time, learn these. They appear often enough to be valuable backups.

| Topic                         | Unit | Type  | Frequency | What to Master                                                                                                                   |
| :---------------------------- | :--- | :---- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Database Recovery**         | 10   | Short | 4/7       | **Techniques**: Know the core idea behind Deferred Update (No-Undo/Redo) vs. Immediate Update (Undo/Redo) and Shadow Paging.     |
| **ER Diagram Concepts**       | 3    | Short | 4/7       | **Symbols**: Define Weak Entity, Specialization/Generalization, and different attribute types (composite, multivalued, derived). |
| **Relational Model Concepts** | 4    | Short | 5/7       | **Terminology**: Define Relation, Attribute, Tuple, Domain, Degree, and Cardinality.                                             |
