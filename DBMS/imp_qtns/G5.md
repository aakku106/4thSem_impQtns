# DBMS – High‑Yield Exam Plan (G5)

Target: Pass comfortably with 35+ marks by studying only the most repeated, high‑ROI topics from 7 sets (2076, 2078, 2079, 2080, 2080_new, 2081, Model).

## Overall strategy

- Full marks: 60 (2 long × 10 + 8 short × 5)
- Pass marks: 24
- Your target: 35+ (prioritizing safe, repeated topics)
- Approach: Pick 2 safest long questions (SQL+RA, Normalization) + 8 high‑probability shorts (FD/Normal forms, ACID, Three‑schema, Serializability, Recovery, Referential Integrity, RA/Natural Join, ER parts) for 40–50 marks potential.

## Long questions (attempt 2) – highest probability

| Topic (pick 2)                             | Frequency (out of 7) | Years                             | Why it repeats                                        | Expected marks |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------: | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------: |
| SQL + Relational Algebra                   |                    5 | 2080, 2080_new, 2081, Model, 2078 | Core skill; easy to test with schema + multi‑part SQL |           9–10 |

| ER Modeling (draw/interpret)               |                    4 | 2078, 2079, 2081, Model           | Conceptual design staple; diagrams fetch marks        |            8–9 |
| Concurrency Control (2PL, TS, deadlock)    |                    4 | 2076, 2078, 2080, 2080_new        | Transactions core; protocols and diagrams             |            7–9 |
| Transactions & Serializability             |                    3 | 2081, 2080_new, Model             | ACID + precedence graph; common theory                |            7–9 |
| DBMS Architecture (3‑schema)               |                    2 | 2079, 2081                        | Foundational architecture                             |            6–8 |

Tip: Prioritize SQL+RA and Normalization. Keep ER and Concurrency as backups.

## Exam‑time picking order

1. Long: SQL+RA → Normalization → ER → Concurrency.
2. Short: FD/Normal forms → ACID → Three‑schema → Serializability → Recovery → Referential Integrity/RA/ER.

Notes for writing answers

- Long (10): intro (1), steps/derivations (5), diagram/tables/examples (3–4), neat conclusion (1).
- Short (5): definition (1), 3 crisp points (2–3), tiny diagram/example (1–2).
