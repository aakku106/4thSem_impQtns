Section A

Attempt any two questions.

1
What is sleep and wakeup? Demonstrate problem with suitable code snippet and illustration.

2
When page fault occurs and how it is handled? Demonstrate second chance and LRU page replacement algorithm for memory with three frames and following reference string: 1,3,7,4,5,2,3,6,4,5,7,8,5,1,4

3
What is I-node? Why it is superior to other file allocation approaches? Consider 20-GB disk with 8-KB block size. How much memory space will be occupied if contiguous, and File allocation table is used for file allocation? Assume that each FAT entry takes 4 byte.

Section B
