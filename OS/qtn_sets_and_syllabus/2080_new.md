SECTION A

Attempt any TWO question.

1
How DMA operation is performed? Consider a disk with 200 tracks and the queue has random requests from different processes in the order : 45, 48, 29, 17, 80, 150, 28 and 188. Find the seek time using FIFO, SSTF and SCAN. Assume the initial position of head as 100.

2
How do you distinguish between deadlock and starvation ? Describec. Explain working mechanism of TLB.

3
