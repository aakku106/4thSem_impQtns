## üéØ **The 35+ Marks Strategy: A Three-Tiered Approach**

Focus on mastering Tier 1 completely, then move to Tier 2. This combination is designed to comfortably get you over the 35-mark threshold. Tier 3 is for securing your score further.

### **Tier 1: The "Guaranteed Marks" Core (Secure 25-30 Marks)**

These topics are your highest priority. They appear in almost every exam, often as high-mark numerical questions. Master these first.

| Topic                             | Unit | Type       | Frequency | What to Master                                                                                                                                                                      | Expected Marks |
| :-------------------------------- | :--- | :--------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| **Process Scheduling Algorithms** | 2    | Long/Short | **7/7**   | **Numerical Problems**: Be able to calculate Average Waiting Time and Turnaround Time for FCFS, SJF, SRTN, Priority, and Round Robin (RR). At least one numerical is guaranteed.    | **10**         |
| **Page Replacement Algorithms**   | 4    | Long/Short | **6/7**   | **Numerical Problems**: Calculate page faults for FIFO, LRU, and Optimal (OPR). Understand the concept and how to apply it to a reference string. Second Chance/Clock also appears. | **10**         |
| **Mutual Exclusion & IPC**        | 2    | Long/Short | **7/7**   | **Concepts**: Understand Race Condition, Critical Section, Semaphores, and the Sleep & Wakeup mechanism. Be ready to explain one of these with its problems and solutions.          | **5-10**       |

**Outcome of Tier 1**: By mastering these three areas, you are positioned to answer **two guaranteed long/numerical questions** and at least **one short question**. This reliably secures **25-30 marks**, getting you past the pass mark and well on your way to 35+.

### **Tier 2: The "High-Probability" Booster (Add 15-20 Marks)**

These topics appear very frequently, mostly as short questions. They are quick to learn and offer a great return on time invested.

| Topic                                  | Unit  | Type       | Frequency | What to Master                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Expected Marks |
| :------------------------------------- | :---- | :--------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| **Disk Scheduling Algorithms**         | 6     | Long/Short | **5/7**   | **Numerical Problems**: Calculate total seek time for FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN. Understand the movement of the disk arm for each.                                                                             | **5-10**       |
| **Deadlock Handling**                  | 3     | Long/Short | **6/7**   | **Banker's Algorithm**: Practice the safety algorithm numerical (checking for a safe state). **Concepts**: Know the four conditions for deadlock and the difference between avoidance, prevention, and detection. | **5-10**       |
| **System Calls & Paging/Segmentation** | 1 & 4 | Short      | **5/7**   | **System Calls**: What they are and how the user-to-kernel mode switch happens. **Paging vs. Segmentation**: Key differences in a table format. Understand how a logical address is translated in each.           | **5**          |
| **File Allocation Methods**            | 5     | Short      | **4/7**   | **Contiguous vs. Linked List vs. Inodes**: Basic concept, one advantage, and one disadvantage of each.                                                                                                            | **5**          |

**Outcome of Tier 2**: Mastering this tier prepares you for **1-2 numericals** and **2-3 theory questions**, adding another **15-20 marks** to your score.

#### Combined Tier 1 + Tier 2 Score Projection: 40-50 Marks

### **Tier 3: The "Safety Net" Topics (Secure 5-10 Extra Marks)**

If you have more time, learn these. They appear often enough to be valuable backups or to answer choice-based questions.

| **Memory Allocation Strategies** | 4    | Short | **First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit**: How each works. Be ready for a simple numerical. |
| **DMA (Direct Memory Access)**   | 6    | Short | The basic working principle and why it's efficient for I/O.                          |
| **Threads vs. Processes**        | 2    | Short | Key differences (memory space, creation time, context switching).                    |
| **Deadlock vs. Starvation**      | 3    | Short | The core distinction between the two.                                                |
| **RAID**                         | 6    | Short | What it stands for and the basic idea behind RAID 0 and RAID 1.                      |

## üó∫Ô∏è **Your Study Roadmap**

1. **Master Scheduling Numericals (Process & Disk)**: This is non-negotiable. Practice at least two problems for each algorithm.
2. **Master Page Replacement Numericals**: This is your second guaranteed high-mark area.
3. **Learn Mutual Exclusion Concepts**: Solidify your understanding of semaphores and race conditions.
4. **Practice Banker's Algorithm**: Work through one safety algorithm numerical to understand the process.
5. **Memorize Theory Differences**: Create tables for Paging vs. Segmentation, Threads vs. Processes, and Deadlock vs. Starvation.
6. **Review Tier 3 Topics**: Quickly go through the remaining concepts.

By following this focused plan, you can efficiently prepare and confidently aim for a score of 35 or higher. Good luck!
