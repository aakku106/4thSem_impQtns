# OS – High‑Yield Exam Plan (G5)

Target: Pass comfortably with 35+ marks by studying only the most repeated, high‑ROI topics from 7 sets (2076, 2078, 2079, 2080, 2080_new, 2081, Model).

## Overall strategy

- Full marks: 60 (2 long × 10 + 8 short × 5)
- Pass marks: 24
- Your target: 35+ (safe picks first, backups ready)
- Approach: Pick 2 safest long questions (Scheduling, Page Replacement; backup Disk) + 8 high‑probability shorts (Mutex/IPC, Memory allocation, System calls, Process vs Thread, File allocation, Deadlock basics, Paging vs Segmentation, DMA/TLB).

Expected from this pack: 38–45 marks. Add Disk scheduling or Deadlock safe‑state for +4–5 more.

## Exam‑time picking order

1. Long: Page Replacement → CPU Scheduling → Disk Scheduling → Banker's.

2. Short: Mutex/IPC → Memory allocation → System calls → Process vs Thread → Deadlock basics → Paging vs Segmentation → DMA/Directory.

## Quick formulas and steps

- Scheduling: WT = TAT − BT; Averages = sum / n; Draw Gantt first.
- Page Replacement: Tabulate frames left→right, count faults; mark hits.
- Disk Scheduling: Seek = absolute head moves; draw direction; SCAN vs LOOK turn.
- Banker’s: Need = Max − Allocation; simulate finish sequence; grant only if safe.

---

## Answer structure

- Long (10): problem restatement (1), stepwise working with tables/diagrams (6–7), final calculation (1), neat layout (1–2).
- Short (5): definition (1), 3 crisp points (2–3), tiny diagram/example (1–2).
