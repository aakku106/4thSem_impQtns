## 📝 Quick Formulas & Key Concepts

### CPU Scheduling

```
Completion Time = Time when process finishes execution
Turnaround Time (TAT) = Completion Time - Arrival Time
Waiting Time (WT) = Turnaround Time - Burst Time
Response Time = Time of first execution - Arrival Time

Average WT = Sum of all WT / Number of processes
Average TAT = Sum of all TAT / Number of processes
```

### Memory Management

```
CPU Utilization = 1 - p^n
where: p = I/O wait probability
       n = number of processes in memory

Logical Address = (Page Number, Page Offset)
Physical Address = (Frame Number, Page Offset)
```

### Disk Scheduling

```
Seek Time = Number of cylinders traversed
Total Seek Time = Sum of all individual seeks

SCAN: Move in one direction to end, then reverse
C-SCAN: Move in one direction to end, jump to start
LOOK: Move to last request, then reverse
C-LOOK: Move to last request, jump to first request on other end
```

### Deadlock (Banker's Algorithm)

```
Need[i,j] = Max[i,j] - Allocation[i,j]

Safe State: There exists a safe sequence where all processes can finish
Grant Request: Only if resulting state is safe
```

### Page Replacement

```
Page Fault: When referenced page is not in memory
Hit Ratio = (Total References - Page Faults) / Total References
Miss Ratio = Page Faults / Total References
```
