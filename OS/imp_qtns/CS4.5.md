## üéØ **The 35+ Marks Strategy: A Three-Tiered Approach**

Focus on mastering Tier 1 completely, then move to Tier 2. This alone will secure your target. Tier 3 is for pushing your score higher if you have extra time.

### **Tier 1: The "Guaranteed Marks" Core (Secure 20-25 Marks)**

These topics are your highest priority. They appear consistently and form the backbone of the exam. Master these first.

| Topic                             | Unit | Type | Frequency | What to Master                                                                                                                                                                                       | Expected Marks |
| :-------------------------------- | :--- | :--- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**     | 2    | Long | **6/7**   | **Algorithms**: FCFS, SJF, SRTN, RR, Priority. Calculate Average Waiting Time (AWT) and Average Turnaround Time (ATT) for given processes. Draw Gantt charts. Know advantages/disadvantages of each. | **10**         |
| **Page Replacement Algorithms**   | 4    | Long | **6/7**   | **Algorithms**: FIFO, LRU, Optimal (OPR), Second Chance, Clock. Given a reference string, calculate page faults for each algorithm. Understand Belady's Anomaly.                                     | **10**         |
| **Disk Scheduling Algorithms**    | 6    | Long | **5/7**   | **Algorithms**: FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, C-LOOK. Calculate total seek time for given disk requests. Draw diagrams showing head movement.                                                      | **10**         |
| **Deadlock (Banker's Algorithm)** | 3    | Long | **3/7**   | **Concepts**: Safe vs Unsafe states. Given allocation/max/available matrices, determine if system is in safe state. Check if resource requests can be granted.                                       | **5-10**       |

**Outcome of Tier 1**: By mastering just these four computational topics, you are positioned to answer **two guaranteed long questions**, securing **20 marks**. These are the most frequent and formulaic questions‚Äîeasy marks if you practice the algorithms.

### **Tier 2: The "High-Probability" Booster (Add 15-20 Marks)**

These topics appear frequently as short questions. They are quick to learn and offer a great return on time invested.

## üìù **Quick Formulas & Key Concepts**

### **CPU Scheduling**

- **Turnaround Time (TAT)** = Completion Time - Arrival Time
- **Waiting Time (WT)** = Turnaround Time - Burst Time
- **Average WT** = Sum of all WT / Number of processes
- **Average TAT** = Sum of all TAT / Number of processes

### **Memory Management**

- **Degree of Multiprogramming** = Number of processes in memory
- **CPU Utilization** = 1 - p^n (where p = I/O wait probability, n = number of processes)
- **Page Fault**: Occurs when referenced page is not in memory

### **Disk Scheduling**

- **Seek Time** = Number of cylinders traversed √ó time per cylinder
- **Total Seek Time** = Sum of all seeks
- **SCAN**: Move in one direction to the end, then reverse
- **C-SCAN**: Move in one direction to the end, jump to start, continue
- **LOOK**: Move in one direction until last request, then reverse

### **Deadlock (Banker's Algorithm)**

- **Need[i,j]** = Max[i,j] - Allocation[i,j]
- **Safe State**: Exists a sequence where all processes can finish
- **Grant Request**: Only if resulting state is safe
