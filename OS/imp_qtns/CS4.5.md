## üìù Quick Formulas & Key Concepts

### CPU Scheduling

```
Completion Time = Time when process finishes execution
Turnaround Time (TAT) = Completion Time - Arrival Time
Waiting Time (WT) = Turnaround Time - Burst Time
Response Time = Time of first execution - Arrival Time

Average WT = Sum of all WT / Number of processes
Average TAT = Sum of all TAT / Number of processes
```

### Memory Management

```
CPU Utilization = 1 - p^n
where: p = I/O wait probability
       n = number of processes in memory

Logical Address = (Page Number, Page Offset)
Physical Address = (Frame Number, Page Offset)
```

### Disk Scheduling

```
Seek Time = Number of cylinders traversed
Total Seek Time = Sum of all individual seeks

SCAN: Move in one direction to end, then reverse
C-SCAN: Move in one direction to end, jump to start
LOOK: Move to last request, then reverse
C-LOOK: Move to last request, jump to first request on other end
```

### Deadlock (Banker's Algorithm)

```
Need[i,j] = Max[i,j] - Allocation[i,j]

Safe State: There exists a safe sequence where all processes can finish
Grant Request: Only if resulting state is safe
```

### Page Replacement

```
Page Fault: When referenced page is not in memory
Hit Ratio = (Total References - Page Faults) / Total References
Miss Ratio = Page Faults / Total References
```

## üìû Important Remember

> **"OS exam rewards practice over theory. Do computational problems daily, and you'll ace the exam!"**

### The Golden Rule

- **Practice makes perfect** - Especially for CPU Scheduling, Page Replacement, and Disk Scheduling
- **Understand, don't memorize** - Understand the logic behind algorithms
- **Time management** - Spend more time on computational questions (they give full marks easily)
- **Answer selection** - In Section B, pick questions you're 100% confident about

### Last Day Before Exam

- Revise all formulas
- Solve 2-3 problems of each computational topic
- Quick revision of comparison tables (Process vs Thread, Paging vs Segmentation)
- Review your short notes
- Sleep well - fresh mind performs better!

## üéØ Success Mantra

```
Master 3 Computational Topics ‚Üí 30 marks (Long Questions)
Master 5-6 Theory Topics ‚Üí 25 marks (Short Questions)
= 55 marks total
Your target: 35+ marks ‚úÖ
Safety margin: 20 marks!
```

**You've got this! Follow this plan, practice daily, and success is guaranteed! üéØ**
