## 🗓️ Day 1: Secure the Pass Mark (12 Hours)

The goal for today is to lock in ~25 marks.

| Time Slot | Duration | Topic - | --- |
| **Slot 1** | **5 Hours** | **Long Q: Routing Algorithms (10 Marks)**<br> - **Focus**: Distance Vector (DV) Routing.<br> - **What to do**: Understand the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Learn how to create routing tables for each node and update them step-by-step based on neighbor information. Practice with a 4-5 node network diagram. Know 2-3 key differences between DV and Link State (LS). |
| **Slot 2** | **4 Hours** | **Short Q1: Subnetting (5 Marks)**<br> - **Focus**: Calculations.<br> - **What to do**: Practice at least 5 problems. Given an IP and CIDR (e.g., `192.168.10.0/27`), you must be able to quickly find: <br> 1. Subnet Mask <br> 2. Total Subnets & Hosts per Subnet <br> 3. Network Address of a subnet <br> 4. Broadcast Address of a subnet <br> 5. Valid Host Range |
| **Slot 3** | **3 Hours** | **Short Q2 & Q3: Switching & Topologies (10 Marks)**<br> - **Switching**: Learn the difference between Circuit Switching and Packet Switching (definitions, pros, cons).<br> - **Topologies**: Learn to draw and list one advantage/disadvantage for Star, Bus, and Ring topologies. |

**End of Day 1 Check:** You can now confidently answer one long question (10 marks) and three short questions (15 marks). **Total: 25 Marks Secured.**

## 🗓️ Day 2: Build the Safety Net (11 Hours)

The goal for today is to learn a backup long question and several easy short questions to guarantee you have choices in the exam.

| Time Slot | Duration | Topic - | --- |
| **Slot 4** | **4 Hours** | **Backup Long Q: Flow Control (10 Marks)**<br> - **Focus**: Stop-and-Wait ARQ.<br> - **What to do**: Learn how it handles errors (lost frames, lost ACKs). The most important thing is to practice drawing the timeline diagrams for these scenarios. Know its main limitation (inefficiency). |
| **Slot 5** | **4 Hours** | **More Short Q's (10 Marks)**<br> - **IPv4 vs. IPv6**: Create a simple comparison table (Address Size, Header Format, Security, Configuration).<br> - **Traffic Shaping**: Understand the basic idea of Leaky Bucket (fixed output rate) and Token Bucket (allows bursts). Know the diagram for each. |
| **Slot 6** | **3 Hours** | **Final Review & Quick Topics**<br> - **Review**: Quickly go over everything from Day 1 (DV Routing, Subnetting).<br> - **Quick Topic**: Learn the difference between TCP (reliable, connection-oriented) and UDP (unreliable, connectionless). |

**End of Day 2 Check:** You can now confidently answer **two** long questions and **five** short questions. This gives you options and a very high chance of scoring **40+ marks**.

## 🎯 Exam Day Game Plan

1. **Read the paper carefully.**
2. **Section A (Long Questions):** Immediately look for **Routing (DV/LS)** or **Flow Control (ARQ)**. Pick one and answer it perfectly. If both are there, you have a choice. This is your first priority.
3. **Section B (Short Questions):** Immediately find the **Subnetting** question. Solve it carefully. This is a guaranteed 5 marks.
4. Next, find and answer **Switching**, **Topologies**, and **IPv4 vs IPv6**.
5. Now, attempt your second long question and the remaining short questions from the topics you prepared.

Good luck. Focus on these topics and you will pass.
