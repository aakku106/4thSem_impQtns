## 🗓️ Day 1: Secure the Pass Mark (12 Hours)

The goal for today is to lock in ~25 marks.

### Slot 1: Routing Algorithms (5 Hours)

- **Goal**: Master one Long Question (10 Marks).
- **Topic**: Distance Vector (DV) Routing.
- **What to do**:
  - Understand the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
  - Learn to create and update routing tables from a network diagram.
  - Practice with a 4-5 node example.
  - Know 2-3 key differences between Distance Vector and Link State.

### Slot 2: Subnetting (4 Hours)

- **Goal**: Master one Short Question (5 Marks).
- **Topic**: Subnetting Calculations.
- **What to do**: Practice at least 5 problems. Given an IP and CIDR (e.g., `192.168.10.0/27`), you must be able to quickly find:
  1. Subnet Mask
  2. Total Subnets & Hosts per Subnet
  3. Network Address of a subnet
  4. Broadcast Address of a subnet
  5. Valid Host Range

### Slot 3: Switching & Topologies (3 Hours)

- **Goal**: Master two Short Questions (10 Marks).
- **Topics**:
  - **Switching**: Learn the definitions, pros, and cons of Circuit Switching vs. Packet Switching.
  - **Topologies**: Be able to draw and list one advantage/disadvantage for Star, Bus, and Ring topologies.

**End of Day 1 Check:** You can now confidently answer one long question (10 marks) and three short questions (15 marks). **Total: 25 Marks Secured.**

## 🗓️ Day 2: Build the Safety Net (11 Hours)

The goal for today is to learn a backup long question and several easy short questions to guarantee you have choices in the exam.

### Slot 4: Flow Control (4 Hours)

- **Goal**: Learn a backup Long Question (10 Marks).
- **Topic**: Stop-and-Wait ARQ.
- **What to do**:
  - Learn how it handles errors (lost frames, lost ACKs).
  - Practice drawing the timeline diagrams for these scenarios.
  - Know its main limitation (inefficiency).

### Slot 5: More Short Questions (4 Hours)

- **Goal**: Learn two more Short Questions (10 Marks).
- **Topics**:
  - **IPv4 vs. IPv6**: Create a simple comparison table (Address Size, Header Format, Security, Configuration).
  - **Traffic Shaping**: Understand the basic idea and diagrams for Leaky Bucket (fixed output rate) and Token Bucket (allows bursts).

### Slot 6: Final Review (3 Hours)

- **Goal**: Revise and solidify knowledge.
- **What to do**:
  - Quickly review Day 1 topics: DV Routing and Subnetting.
  - Learn the key differences between TCP (reliable, connection-oriented) and UDP (unreliable, connectionless).

**End of Day 2 Check:** You can now confidently answer **two** long questions and **five** short questions. This gives you options and a very high chance of scoring **40+ marks**.

## 🎯 Exam Day Game Plan

1. **Read the paper carefully.**
2. **Section A (Long Questions):** Immediately look for **Routing (DV/LS)** or **Flow Control (ARQ)**. Pick one and answer it perfectly. This is your first priority.
3. **Section B (Short Questions):** Immediately find the **Subnetting** question. Solve it carefully. This is a guaranteed 5 marks.
4. Next, find and answer **Switching**, **Topologies**, and **IPv4 vs IPv6**.
5. Now, attempt your second long question and the remaining short questions from the topics you prepared.

Good luck. Focus on these topics and you will pass.
