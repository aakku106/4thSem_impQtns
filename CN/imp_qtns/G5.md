# Computer Networks – High‑Yield Exam Plan (G5)

Target: Pass comfortably with 35+ marks by studying only the most repeated, high‑ROI topics from 7 sets (2076, 2078, 2079, 2080, 2080_new, 2081, Model).

## Overall strategy

- Full marks: 60 (2 long × 10 + 8 short × 5)
- Pass marks: 24
- Your target: 35+ (prioritizing safe, repeated topics)
- Approach: Pick 2 safest long questions (routing, flow control) + 8 high‑probability shorts (subnetting, switching, MAC/LLC, IPv6 vs IPv4, routing types, traffic shaping/VC/DNS) for 40–50 marks potential.

## Exam‑time picking order

1. Long: Routing → Flow Control → TCP header → CRC (backup).

2. Short: Subnetting → Switching → MAC/LLC → IPv6 vs IPv4 → Routing comparisons → Traffic shaping/VC/DNS.

Notes for writing answers

- Long (10): intro/definition (1), steps/working (4–5), diagram/table/example (3–4), conclusion/compare (1).
- Short (5): definition (1), core points (2–3), tiny diagram/example (1–2).
