## üéØ **The 35+ Marks Strategy: A Three-Tiered Approach**

Focus on mastering Tier 1 completely, then move to Tier 2. This alone will secure your target. Tier 3 is for pushing your score higher if you have extra time.

### **Tier 1: The "Guaranteed Marks" Core (Secure 20-25 Marks)**

These topics are your highest priority. They appear consistently and form the backbone of the exam. Master these first.

| Topic                    | Unit | Type  | Frequency | What to Master                                                                                                                                                                                               | Expected Marks |
| :----------------------- | :--- | :---- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| **Routing Algorithms**   | 4    | Long  | **5/7**   | **Distance Vector & Link State**: Algorithm steps, creating routing tables from a diagram, and a solid comparison of their differences (convergence, overhead, complexity).                                  | **10**         |
| **Subnetting**           | 4    | Short | **7/7**   | **Calculations**: Given an IP and a requirement (e.g., `/27` or "4 subnets"), find the new subnet mask, network/broadcast addresses, and valid host ranges for each subnet. Practice with Class A, B, and C. | **5**          |
| **Flow & Error Control** | 3    | Long  | **4/7**   | **Stop-and-Wait ARQ**: How it works, including handling lost frames and lost ACKs (use timeline diagrams). Compare it with Go-Back-N ARQ.                                                                    | **10**         |

**Outcome of Tier 1**: By mastering just these three areas, you are positioned to answer **one guaranteed long question** and **one guaranteed short question**, securing **15 marks**. Since you often have a choice, you can pick the routing or flow control question, making it a very safe bet. Realistically, this tier prepares you for about **20-25 marks** as these topics also appear in other forms.

### **Tier 2: The "High-Probability" Booster (Add 15-20 Marks)**

These topics appear frequently as short questions. They are quick to learn and offer a great return on time invested.

| Topic                    | Unit | Type  | Frequency | What to Master                                                                                                                        | Expected Marks |
| :----------------------- | :--- | :---- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------- |
| **Switching Techniques** | 2    | Short | **5/7**   | **Circuit vs. Packet Switching**: Key differences, advantages, and disadvantages of each. Know the three phases of circuit switching. | **5**          |
| **Data Link Control**    | 3    | Short | **6/7**   | **MAC & LLC**: Functions of each sublayer. **CSMA/CD, Token Bus/Ring**: Basic working principle and where they are used.              | **5**          |
| **IPv4 vs. IPv6**        | 4    | Short | **4/7**   | A comparison table covering address size, header format, configuration (manual vs. auto), and security (IPSec).                       | **5**          |
| **Traffic Shaping**      | 5    | Short | **3/7**   | **Leaky Bucket & Token Bucket**: The algorithm logic for each, their key difference (bursty traffic handling), and a simple diagram.  | **5**          |

**Outcome of Tier 2**: Mastering this tier prepares you for **3-4 additional short questions**, adding another **15-20 marks** to your score.

**Combined Tier 1 + Tier 2 Score Projection: 35-45 Marks**

### **Tier 3: The "Safety Net" Topics (Secure 5-10 Extra Marks)**

If you have more time, learn these. They appear often enough to be valuable backups.

| Topic                     | Unit | Type  | Frequency | What to Master                                                                      |
| :------------------------ | :--- | :---- | :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TCP vs. UDP**           | 5    | Short | Common    | Key differences (connection-oriented vs. connectionless, reliability, header size). |
| **DNS**                   | 6    | Short | 4/7       | Hierarchy (root, TLD, authoritative), and query types (recursive vs. iterative).    |
| **Virtual Circuits**      | 3    | Short | 3/7       | **Frame Relay & ATM**: What they are and their basic characteristics.               |
| **Network Architectures** | 7    | Short | 4/7       | **SDN & NGN**: Basic architecture diagram and 2-3 key features of each.             |
| **Network Topologies**    | 1    | Short | 4/7       | **Star, Bus, Ring**: Diagram, one advantage, and one disadvantage for each.         |
