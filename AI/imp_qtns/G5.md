# Artificial Intelligence – High‑Yield Exam Plan (G5)

Target: Pass comfortably with 35+ marks by studying only the most repeated, high‑ROI topics from 7 sets (2076, 2078, 2079, 2080, 2080_new, 2081, Model).

## Overall strategy

- Full marks: 60 (2 long × 10 + 8 short × 5)
- Pass marks: 24
- Your target: 35+ (safe picks first, backups ready)
- Approach: Pick 2 safest long questions (Resolution in FOPL, Informed Search trace; backup ANN) + 8 high‑probability shorts (Agents/PEAS, NLP steps, Semantic net/Frames, Min‑Max, Expert Systems, GA ops, Naive Bayes basics, Turing test/Environments).

| Naive Bayes (supervised learning)                         |                    1 | 2080_new                                      | Occasional long; often short                                  |            7–9 |
| Expert System Development / Knowledge Engineering         |                    1 | 2079                                          | Process write‑up with block diagram                           |            7–9 |

Tip: Prioritize Resolution + Informed Search. Keep ANN as the backup long.

## Exam‑time picking order

1. Long: Resolution → Informed Search → ANN → Naive Bayes/Expert System

2. Short: Agents/PEAS → NLP → Semantic net/Frames → Min‑Max → Expert System → GA ops → Naive Bayes → Turing/Environments

## Quick formulas and steps

- Naive Bayes: P(C|x) ∝ P(x|C) P(C); assume conditional independence across features
- A\*: f(n) = g(n) + h(n); choose lowest f; Greedy uses only h(n); Hill‑climb uses local best
- Min‑Max: backup values from leaves; α‑β prunes when β ≤ α
- Resolution: Eliminate →, push ¬ inward, Skolemize, standardize, CNF, resolve complementary literals
- Perceptron: w ← w + η(y − ŷ) x; bias update b ← b + η(y − ŷ)

---

## Answer structure

- Long (10): problem restatement (1), stepwise working with tables/diagrams (6–7), final calculation/derivation (1), neat layout (1–2)
- Short (5): definition (1), 3 crisp points (2–3), tiny diagram/example (1–2)

Analysis based on: 2076, 2078, 2079, 2080, 2080_new, 2081, and Model question sets.
