## 🎯 **The 35+ Marks Strategy: A Three-Tiered Approach**

Focus on mastering Tier 1 completely, then move to Tier 2. This combination is designed to comfortably get you over the 35-mark threshold. Tier 3 is for securing your score further.

### **Tier 1: The "Guaranteed Marks" Core (Secure 20-25 Marks)**

These topics are your highest priority. They appear in almost every exam, often as high-mark numerical or logical problems. Master these first.

| Topic                                | Unit | Type       | Frequency | What to Master                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Expected Marks |
| :----------------------------------- | :--- | :--------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| **Informed Search Algorithms**       | 3    | Long       | **5/7**   | **Numerical Problems**: Be able to trace the path for **A\*** and **Greedy Best-First Search** using a given state space graph, costs, and heuristics. Understand the difference in how they select nodes.         | **10**         |
| **Knowledge Rep. using Logic**       | 4    | Long       | **5/7**   | **Resolution in FOPL**: Master the process of converting English sentences to First-Order Predicate Logic (FOPL), converting FOPL to CNF (clausal form), and using the resolution algorithm to prove a conclusion. | **10**         |
| **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** | 5    | Long/Short | **5/7**   | **Backpropagation/Perceptron**: Understand the mathematical model of a neuron. Be prepared to explain the Backpropagation algorithm steps or solve a simple problem with Perceptron learning.                      | **5-10**       |

**Outcome of Tier 1**: By mastering these three areas, you are positioned to answer **two guaranteed long/numerical questions** and at least **one short question**. This reliably secures **25 marks**, getting you past the pass mark and well on your way to 35+.

### **Tier 2: The "High-Probability" Booster (Add 15-20 Marks)**

These topics appear very frequently, mostly as short questions. They are quick to learn and offer a great return on time invested.

| Topic                                 | Unit | Type  | Frequency | What to Master                                                                                                                                                                                               | Expected Marks |
| :------------------------------------ | :--- | :---- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| **Game Playing (Min-Max)**            | 3    | Short | **4/7**   | **Min-Max Algorithm**: Given a game tree with utility values, trace the Min-Max algorithm to determine the best move for the MAX player. Alpha-Beta pruning is a bonus but Min-Max is more frequent.         | **5**          |
| **Intelligent Agents**                | 2    | Short | **6/7**   | **PEAS & Agent Types**: Be able to define a PEAS framework for any given agent (e.g., "Internet Shopping Assistant"). Know the key differences between Simple Reflex, Model-Based, and Utility-Based agents. | **5**          |
| **Expert Systems**                    | 6    | Short | **4/7**   | **Components**: Know the main components of an expert system (Knowledge Base, Inference Engine, User Interface, Working Memory) and their functions.                                                         | **5**          |
| **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** | 6    | Short | **5/7**   | **Steps of NLP**: Memorize the main steps (Lexical, Syntactic, Semantic, Pragmatic Analysis) and be able to briefly describe what happens in each.                                                           | **5**          |

**Outcome of Tier 2**: Mastering this tier prepares you for **3-4 additional short questions**, adding another **15-20 marks** to your score.

**Combined Tier 1 + Tier 2 Score Projection: 40-45 Marks**

## 🗺️ **Your Study Roadmap**

1.  **Master A\* and Greedy Search**: This is non-negotiable. Practice at least three problems of tracing the search path on a graph.
2.  **Master FOPL Resolution**: This is your second guaranteed high-mark area. Practice converting sentences and applying the resolution steps.
3.  **Learn Agent Concepts**: Solidify your understanding of PEAS frameworks and the different agent types. This is an easy and frequent 5 marks.
4.  **Practice Min-Max Algorithm**: Work through one or two game trees to understand the process.
5.  **Memorize NLP & Expert System Concepts**: These are straightforward theory questions that appear consistently.
6.  **Review Tier 3 Topics**: Quickly go through the remaining concepts for backup.

By following this focused plan, you can efficiently prepare and confidently aim for a score of 35 or higher. Good luck!
