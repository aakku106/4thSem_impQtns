Section A

Attempt any two questions.

1
What do you mean by heuristic search? Given following state space representation, show how greedy best firsh and A\* search is used to find the goal state.

S is the start state and G is the goal state. The heuristics of the states are:

h(S) = 12, h(A)=8, h(D)=9, h(B)=7, h(E)= 4, h(C)=5, h(F)=2, h(G)=0.

2
How resolution algorithm is used as a rule of inference in predicate logic? Convert the following sentences into FOPL.

All over smart person’s are stupid.
Children’s of all stupid persons arre naughty
Roney is children of Harry
Harry is over smart
Prove that “Roney is naughty” using resolution algorithm.

3
What is artificial neural network? Define its mathematical model. Discuss how back propagation algorithm is used to train ANN.

Section B

Attempt any eight questions.

4
Describe how Turing test is used to define AI as acting humanly.

5
Differentiate between model based and simple reflex agent with an example.

6
What is natural language processing? Discuss the steps of natural language processing.

7
How belief networks are constructed? Consider the probability of having cloudy is 50%. The probability that it will rain given the conditions it will be cloudy and if it is winter is 30%. The probability of being winter is 50%. The probability that it will be shin is 70%. Now construct a belief network for this example.

8
What is expert system? Explain the major components of expert system.

9
What is supervised learning? Discuss how Naive Bayes model works.

10
Construct semantic network for following facts

Ram is person. Persons are humans. All human have nose. Humans are instances of mammals. Ram has weight of 60 kg. Weight of Ram is less than weight of Sita.

11
