Section A

Attempt any TWO questions

1
Show that, For any NFA N=(Q, ∑, δ, q0, F) accepting language L=∑, There is a DFA D= (Q’, ∑’, q0′, δ’, F’) accepting the same language L.

2
State and prove the Pumping Lemma for regular languages. How can you show with example that pumping lemma is used to prove that a given language is not a regular? Explain.

3
Given the following expression grammar for simple arithematic expression with operator + and \*.

E→ E+T | T

T → T+F | F

F → (E) | a

Remove the left recursion from this grammar then simplify and convert to CNF.

Section B

Attempt any EIGHT questions

4
Explain the ε-closure of states on an ε-NFA with suitable examples.

5
Convert the following regular expression into equivalent Finite Automata

a. (0+1)\*10(1+0)

b. 1*0(0+1)*1

6
Define the term: Parse Tree, left-most and right-most derivation, sentential form and ambiguity with example.

7
Give the formal definiton of Push Down Automata. How CFG can be converted into equivalent PDA. Explain with an example.

8
Define regular grammar. Also explain the method of converting right linear grammar into equivalent finite automata.

9
Construct a Turing machine that accepts the language, L = { an bn | n≥0}

10
Define Turing machine and its roles.

11
Explain about the complexity classes p, NP and NP-Complete.

12
