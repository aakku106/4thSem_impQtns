Section A

Attempt any two questions.

1
Define the extended transition function of DFA. Draw a DFA accepting language L = {1n | n = 2, 3, 4…. }. Show acceptance of strings 1110011 and 1110 using extended transition function.

2
What is deterministic pushdown automaton? Configure a pushdown automaton accepting the language, L={w C wR | w ∈ (0,1)\*}. Show instantaneous description of strings 011C110 and 10C10.

3
How a Turing Machine works? Construct a Turing machine accepting the language L = {(n)n}. Also show the transition diagram of the machine. Illustrate whether a string (()) is accepted by the Turing machine or not.

Section B

Attempt any eight questions.

4
When a grammar is said to be in CNF? Convert the following grammar to CNF:

S → 1A | 0B | ε

A → 1AA | 0S | 0

B → 0BB | 1 | A

C → CA | CS

5
Define epsilon NFA. Configure equivalent epsilon NFA for the regular expression (ab U a)\*.

6
Differentiate Kleene closure from positive closure. For ∑ = {0,1}, compute ∑\* and ∑2.

7
Write the regular expression over {0,1} for strings

Not ending with 0
Of length at least 3 that ends with 00.
8
What is undecidable problem? Define post’s correspondence problem with an example.

9
How pumping lemma can be used to prove that any language is not a regular language? Show that language, L = {0n1n | n>0} is not a regular language.

10
Discuss how Turing Machine with multiple tracks differs from a Turing Machine with multiple tapes.

11
How context free grammars are defined? Write a context free grammar over {0,1}, where the strings start and end with the same symbol.

12
What is halting problem? How can you argue that halting problem is undecidable?
